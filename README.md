 # wildfire-tracker-dev
Development build for the wildfire tracker.

Based off of current fire locations found at: `https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/fire-locations-current`

Built with create-react-app.

### 
Data is pulled from Heroku app – `fast-forest-46102` – that runs once a day at 8:30am UTC (1:30am Pacific). Provincial wildfire data is updated daily at midnight.

DEV TO DO

1. stat-boxes as toggles for fire components
2. add "fires near me" search box (by postal?)
